Hello!

My name is Maria or Masha. I am a Front-end developer with a background in digital marketing, design and usability (10+ years).

I thought for a long time what I wanted to do. In 2022, I made a conscious decision to become a web-developer. So in January 2023 I completed from the Yandex “Web-developer” course. During my studying, the thought that I had found what I wanted to do did not leave me. Now I’m looking for my first job as a web-developer.

As developer I have such skills as:

- HTML, CSS
- JavaScript, React.js
- Visual Studio Code, Figma, Photoshop
- Git, Webpack

Now I live in US and looking for a job as a junior programmer here. My superpower is perfectionism and organization skills.
