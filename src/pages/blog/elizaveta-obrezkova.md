Hello!

My name is Elizaveta Obrezkova. I’m a beginner web-developer now, but I have a very long story.
I was born on the 16th of January, 1996 in Saint-Petersburg. This city is the best city in the world, where I lived almost all my life. I graduated from high school in 2013 and entered Saint-Petersburg University of Economics. I completed my bachelor's degree in economics and received a diploma with distinction. Then I completed my master's degree in accounting. Moreover, my piggy bank was replenished with another diploma with honors. Studying at the university, I was looking for myself. At that time, I received two more educations: a primary school teacher and a fitness trainer. Each of them was important to me, but none of them suited me.

I thought for a long time what I wanted to do. In 2022, I made a conscious decision to become a web-developer. So in January 2023 I completed from the Yandex “Web-developer” course. During my studying, the thought that I had found what I wanted to do did not leave me. Now I’m looking for my first job as a web-developer.

As developer I have such skills as:
-	HTML, CSS
-	Responsive design
-	basic knowledge of Bootstrap
-	JavaScript
-	React.js
-	Node.js, Express.js
-	Figma, Photoshop
-	Git

Also I have the background I’ve learned on previous jobs:
-	teamwork
-	Strong numeracy skills
-	Strong creative ability
-	Attention to detail
-	Strong communication skills
-	Excellent problem-solving skills
-	A logical approach to work
-	The ability to explain technical matters clearly

Now I live in Bali and do two internships. I already have several portfolio projects that you can see here: https://github.com/Elizaveta-Obrezkova . Also in the process of development is a site for my friends. I really hope to be able to share it soon.
