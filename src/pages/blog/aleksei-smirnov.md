My name is Aleksei Smirnov. I’m a beginner web-developer. Currently I’m looking for my first job as a frontend developer. I want to find a team with life values which are close to mine. 

I’ve been working for more than 10 years in the field of Power Supply. After graduating from university in 2010 I’ve been working for 4 years as an engineer for an electrical company. Then I’ve realized I want to do something on my own. That’s why I’ve started to work as a self-employed electrician. 

Years go by and now I want to move forward. I’ve always been interested in IT, but something always stopped me from changing my career. 1,5 years ago I made up my mind to do the first steps in programming. And so in January 2023 I graduated from the Yandex “Web-developer” course.

These days I am working on commercial and pet projects in the field of web-development. As developer I have such skills as:
- basic knowledge of Frontend development, 
- basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
- basic knowledge of React, Redux,
- basic knowledge of Node.js, Express,
- basic knowledge of Figma, Photoshop,
- understanding of principles of web-development,
- understanding of basics of version control systems (Git),
- addiction to learn something new.

Also I have the background I’ve learned on previous jobs:
- teamwork
- a bit of SMM,
- responsible way of living,
- communication is the key to solve problems

As you can see I already have a background but my eyes are still wide open to explore this world. Here is some projects of mine:

1. Georgian alphabet trainer. App which helps to memorize Georgian letters.

2. Diploma project. Fullstack development of Kinopoisk analog.

3. Multi Page site layout. Commercial project.

4. Pet project to learn Redux. Sorting, filtering, adding editing employees in the list.

Currently working on SPA for an electrical company.
