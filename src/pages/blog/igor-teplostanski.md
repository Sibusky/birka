Hello!

My name is Igor Teplostanski. I am a beginner frontend developer. I've always liked internet art, especially net-art. And the desire to create something similar led me into Web development. That is why I strive for professional growth and development in the Front-end field.

In my free time I like to customize GNU/Linux and study terminal utilities.
I am ready to spend more than one day studying the problem until I solve it.

As developer I have such skills as:

- HTML, CSS, SCSS
- Responsive design
- basic knowledge of Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- MobX
- React.js
- Node.js, Express.js
- Figma
- Git
