My name is Alexander Semenov. I have basic knowledge acquired through the Yandex Practicum Web Developer course. I try to expand the boundaries of what I have learned step by step, discovering new things while not forgetting the old. Currently, I work in aviation.

Fun fact about me: I can identify what type of airplane is starting its engines just by the sound.
